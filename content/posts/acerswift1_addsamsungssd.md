A couple of month ago I was thinking about buying a new ultrabook because my currently Acer Swift 1 with 4GB RAM and 64GB SSD was a little slow. The SSD also limited what program and data I could have with me.

I needed an ultrabook with at least 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD, checking out new ultrabooks I ended up with a price around 6000 SEK (~$667). A lot of money considering that I had bought the Acer Swift only 1 year ago.

By the years I have learned to always see if there were other options so I reconsidered the requirement. Could I upgrade the Acer Swift 1 with a faster and larger SSD to achieve enough performance and capacity? Performance should probably increase because of faster swapping of RAM to/from a faster SSD. So why don't give it a try.

As I have a few Samsung SSD in other desktop machines and is pleased with their performance I selected the Samsung 860 EVO M.2 250GB SSD. 250GB should be more than enough for my usage.

The Acer Swift 1 is quite hard to open thus I needed to buy a laptop repair kit.

And after a while I manage to open it. I also needed to carefully loosen a cabel connector that was placed so that the cable went over the M.2 slot. Then it was easy to mount the M.2 2280 SSD and re-attach the cable connector.

After reinstalling Windows 10 on the new SSD it turned out that the laptop got a lot faster and I was really pleased with the upgrade.

## Saving calculation

So my decision worked out very well this time and the savings were hugh. 

| Caclulation   | Amount($)  | Amount(SEK) |
|:------------- |:----------:| :---------: |
| New ultrabook | ~667        | 6000        |
| SSD upgrade   | ~111        | 1000        |
| Savings       | ~889        | 5000        |

Investing the saved money 5000:-(~$889) in one of the Dividend Aristocrats stock having 3% yield and 5% dividend growth would give me more than 926:- ($103), 18,2% yield on cost, every year (and growing) in dividend after 20 year (for the future me).

NOTE 1: All $ values is calculated with a SEK/USD ratio of 9.

## Conclution

If someone is in the same situation, I really recommend doing this upgrade and save a lot of money!

NOTE 2: You are responsible for any damage of your ultrabook when performing upgrades on it!
